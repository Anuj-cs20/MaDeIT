                <p class="carddata">Many New Thought books leave one wanting a bit more. They claim that
                    there is a
                    deeper secret of life, but refrain from
                    explaining it. Nathan R. Woods, on the other hand, pulls no punches.

                    when she wrote The Outsiders in high school, with a book that spoke directly to
                    her peers. Ponyboy's journey shows that things can go too far very quickly when
                    you're willing to do anything to belong.
